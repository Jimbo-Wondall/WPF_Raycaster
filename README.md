# WPF_Raycaster
I've just started a diploma in programming and this one of the projects I've started on the side to help me get familiar with WPF.
It's a pretty janky raycasting engine where:
You can run around with WASD
Look with L/R arrows
Jump with SPACE
Crouch with SHIFT

The map on the right can be used to draw and edit the map in real time, just select a swatch and draw away. Paint with left mouse and erase with right mouse.

You can add or edit a swatch but I don't recommend doing so because its a bit buggy

You can also save and import maps by using the controls below the swatches.
- When you save a map it will create a new .txt file on your desktop with the map you're currently using.
- To load a map just right click the .txt file you want to load, and paste it in the little text box above the buttons then click load.

The game will crash if the little shreks touch you, its a bug but it's the only gameplay at the moment.

Keen to hear any feedback if anyones stumbles across this as I'm just starting out.
